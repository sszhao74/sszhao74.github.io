During her stay, Luoying presented a seminar on her research, which generated engaging discussions and valuable feedback from faculty members and students at the Institute of Applied Computer Science. She also took the opportunity to communicate closely with researchers there, exchanging ideas and exploring possibilities for future collaboration.

In addition to her academic activities, Luoying explored the cities of Warsaw, Łódź, Gdańsk, and Kraków, gaining first-hand experience of Polish culture and history. This visit not only broadened her academic horizons but also helped to strengthen the connections between our lab and international partners.
