This week, the **Kowloon Interaction Design Center (KLIC)** hosted a session led by **Professor Zhu Kening** focused on **Tangible User Interfaces (TUI)**. The session explored how **paper and clay** can be used to create buttons and touch sensors.

The session was designed to be **hands-on**, encouraging participants to engage with physical materials rather than working solely on screens. Students were invited to bring their **laptops**, preferably with **USB Type A ports or adapters**, to connect with the materials.

During the session, participants experimented with making physical components function as touch-sensitive inputs, gaining practical experience in TUI design. Professor Zhu guided attendees through the process of turning everyday materials into interactive elements, providing a tangible approach to understanding user interfaces.

This session is part of **KLIC’s bi-weekly activities**, which aim to create a collaborative and learning-focused environment for labs and students interested in Human–Computer Interaction.
