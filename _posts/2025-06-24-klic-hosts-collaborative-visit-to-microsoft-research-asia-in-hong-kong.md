Between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM, representatives from CityU—including both faculty and students—shared their current research interests, challenges, and ideas for potential partnerships. This flexible session encouraged open dialogue and mutual learning.

The visit continued with a guided tour of MSRA’s office space, offering guests a behind-the-scenes look at the institute’s working environment. The day concluded with a group photo session at 5:00 PM, marking the end of a productive and inspiring visit.

This exchange not only strengthened ties between CityU and MSRA but also opened doors for future collaboration in HCI and related fields.
