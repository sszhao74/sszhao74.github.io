Dr. Kenny Choo, Assistant Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), delivered a talk titled “Designing for ‘We’: Expanding Collective Capability through Society-Centred AI” on February 6, 2026.

The talk explored a shift in Human–AI Interaction from traditional user-centred approaches toward community-centred and society-centred AI. Dr. Choo shared research across multiple social scales, including multimodal systems that enhance individual expression, expert-aligned large language models supporting parent–child interactions, and AI-assisted advance care planning for complex ethical decisions. Together, these projects illustrated how AI can move beyond individual use to strengthen collective agency and social collaboration.

The session was held in person at M6058, with additional participants joining online. The event was organized by the Greater Bay ACM SIGCHI Chapter as part of its ongoing efforts to foster research exchange and dialogue in Human–Computer Interaction.
