A group from Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) recently joined a session featuring student presentations and feedback exchange. The event provided an opportunity for students to share their work and receive comments from experienced professionals in the field.

**The MSRA attendees included:** 
- Lily Sun, Director of the MSRA Accelerator Team
- Shujie Liu, Principal Researcher
- Beibei Shi, Principal Research Program Manager
- Jinglu Wang, Senior Researcher
- Yun Wang, Senior Researcher

During the session, several students presented their research ideas and ongoing projects. The MSRA visitors offered feedback, contributing their perspectives and engaging with the presenters.

The session served as a valuable platform for interaction between students and researchers, encouraging thoughtful discussion and reflection. KLIC appreciates the participation of the MSRA team and the time they dedicated to engaging with the student work.
