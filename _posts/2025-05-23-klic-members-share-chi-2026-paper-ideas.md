On May 23, 2025, members of the Kowloon Interaction Center (KLIC) came together at the SCM Social Media Lab M7001 for a focused CHI 2026 Idea Sharing Session, marking a productive moment of reflection and forward planning following CHI 2025.

The session featured six project ideas, each presented in a 5-minute slot. Presenters shared a range of content—from early-stage concepts to summaries of ongoing research—with the goal of receiving feedback and exploring collaboration opportunities within the group.

After the presentations, participants engaged in open discussion, offering constructive feedback, raising insightful questions, and identifying synergies across projects. The session fostered a collegial and creative atmosphere, reinforcing KLIC’s commitment to collaborative research and early-stage idea development.

**Participants included:** ZHU Zihao, LIANG Minhui, Prof. ZHAO Shengdong, Aochen Jiao, Xinyu Guo, Zhang Youpeng, AP, Jussi, Zhaohui Liang, Prof. LIU Can, YANG Xuyu, Zhuangze Hou, Qianwan, Xingyu Zhou, Nuwan Janaka N P K, Qiuyuan Ren, ZHENG Xi, Jinghong Lin, Cai Runze, YAO Rui, Jingze Tian, and Prof. ZHU Kening.

This internal session exemplifies KLIC’s collaborative spirit and its dedication to advancing HCI research through shared knowledge and mutual support. As the CHI 2026 submission cycle begins, the ideas discussed today are expected to evolve into impactful contributions.
