On May 14, 2025, the **Greater Bay ACM SIGCHI Chapter** hosted a distinguished seminar featuring **Prof. Joseph Jay Williams**, Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto and Director of the Intelligent Adaptive Interventions Lab. Held at the CMC 7001 Social Media Lab, CityU, and streamed via Zoom, the event attracted a diverse audience of researchers, students, and practitioners in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

Prof. Williams delivered a compelling talk titled **“Using Adaptive Experimentation to Design Intelligent Interventions for Belief & Behaviour Change.”** He introduced *Intelligent Interventions*—personalized prompts, educational content, and health messages—powered by the **AdaptEx framework**. This innovative system integrates large language models (LLMs), crowdsourcing, and adaptive A/B testing to optimize digital interventions in real time. By transforming interface elements into learning agents, AdaptEx enables rapid experimentation and continuous improvement in user engagement and behavior change. <br />

With over 85 publications and accolades including Best Paper awards and 1st place in the 1M dollars Xprize for experimentation technology, Prof. Williams’ research has impacted over 500,000 users globally. His interdisciplinary work spans computer science, psychology, statistics, and AI, supported by more than 2M dollars in research funding.

The **Greater Bay ACM SIGCHI Chapter**, a network of HCI researchers across the Greater Bay Area of China, organized this event to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration. The talk exemplified their mission to connect technology, industry, and humanities through impactful HCI research.
