The AI (Vibe) Coding Workshop was held on Thursday, January 15, 2026, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM at SCM 4003, and was led by Cai Runze.

The two-hour session introduced participants to using large language models (LLMs) as practical coding partners to support planning, code generation, and iterative development. Guided examples included creating a static personal website, building small tools to support HCI projects, and developing a simple full-stack web application with the front-end hosted on GitHub Pages and a backend using Supabase.

The workshop provided attendees with a repeatable workflow for turning ideas into functional prototypes through AI-assisted coding.
