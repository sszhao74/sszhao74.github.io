The second KLIC meeting of the semester was held on Monday, February 9, from 10:00–12:00, bringing members together for a focused discussion on improving research visuals.

The session, titled “The Visualization Checklist: To-Dos, No-Nos, and Rules of Thumb,” shared practical strategies for designing clearer and more effective visualizations. Topics included common pitfalls, useful heuristics, and actionable tips that can be applied to academic papers, final presentations, and exploratory projects.

The meeting took place in person at CMC 6058, with additional participants joining remotely via Zoom. The session encouraged active discussion and reflection on how thoughtful visualization choices can strengthen research communication.
