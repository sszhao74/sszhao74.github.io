On Friday, August 15, 2025, KLIC held a focused session on a topic highly relevant to HCI researchers: how to write the discussion section in HCI papers. The meeting took place at 3:00 PM, with participants joining both in person at CMC 7001 and online via Zoom.

The session aimed to support students preparing submissions for CHI and other major HCI conferences by unpacking the purpose and structure of the discussion section—a critical part of any academic paper. Participants were invited to reflect on how to effectively communicate the implications of their findings, connect results to broader research questions, and position their contributions within the field.

To help organize the session and tailor it to attendees’ needs, students were asked to fill out a short Google form in advance. This allowed the facilitator to better understand participants’ current writing challenges and expectations.

The session encouraged open sharing and practical advice, helping students think critically about how to frame their work and engage with reviewers. While the format and specific activities were not detailed, the invitation emphasized the goal of making the session beneficial for those actively working on CHI submissions.

This meeting reflects KLIC’s ongoing commitment to supporting student development through timely, research-focused discussions. By addressing common challenges in academic writing, KLIC continues to foster a collaborative environment where students can grow as researchers and communicators.
