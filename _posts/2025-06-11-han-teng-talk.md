Abstract:

*Intelligent information technologies such as embodied intelligence and spatial intelligence promote the evolution of human-machine interaction towards complex spatial tasks, stimulate human instinctive needs for multi-channel perceptions such as vision, touch, and proprioception, and transcend the limitations of traditional screens. Visual-touch fusion is an interactive paradigm innovation driven by spatial task requirements, which helps the efficient and intelligent development of human-machine-environment collaboration. Its core lies in multidisciplinary cross-disciplinary research to address the perceptual and cognitive problems of visual-touch stimulation and the challenge of lagging development of tactile technology. The research team combined the model framework of cognitive processing and motion control, and expanded the multi-sensory feedback mechanism of vision, touch, etc. with sensory conflict and motion constraints as the main line, providing a theoretical basis for conducting research on the visual-touch fusion interaction paradigm. In view of the limitations of traditional tactile actuation technology, the research team developed a thin and light structure, high-efficiency, and high-temporal and spatial resolution electrotactile interface to expand its tactile rendering capabilities, and initially developed a visual-touch integrated human-machine collaborative interaction platform to serve important human-machine collaborative interaction fields such as embodied intelligence and remote operation.*
