Last weekend, on March 23rd and 24th, the Synteraction Lab hosted a successful KLIC retreat aimed at fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among students.

The KLIC (Kowloon Interaction Center) retreat brought together students focusing on HCI at City University of Hong Kong. The event, spanning two days, served as a platform for participants to build relationships, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and establish KLIC as a hub for interaction.

The first day of the retreat was dedicated to introductions and acquaintances, allowing attendees to get to know each other and lay the foundation for future collaborations. On the second day, discussions and planning sessions were held.
