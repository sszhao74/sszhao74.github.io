KLIC (Kowloon Interaction Center) is an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) group at City University of Hong Kong. We organize regular bi-weekly activities for the labs and students within the organization. These activities include various workshops and seminars aimed at fostering a collaborative and learning environment.


## Mission
KLIC's primary mission is to build a vibrant community for HCI researchers at CityU. By bringing together faculty members, research staff, and students interested in Human-Computer Interaction, we create an environment that encourages:
* Knowledge sharing and cross-lab collaboration
* Research innovation and exploration
* Professional development opportunities
* Peer learning and mentorship
* Academic discourse and idea exchange

Our bi-weekly activities serve as a platform for members to present their research, learn from peers, and explore potential collaborations within the HCI domain.
