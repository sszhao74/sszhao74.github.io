He shared findings from studies on speech emotion recognition, discussing the complexities of distinguishing between genuine and acted emotions, as well as the role of machine learning models in identifying subtle emotional differences.</p> <p>The seminar also touched upon ethical concerns, including potential biases and the broader societal impact of emotionally intelligent systems. Dr. Ma underscored the importance of user-centered design in crafting empathetic and culturally inclusive voice technologies.</p> <p>For those interested in further exploring this research, Dr. Ma‚Äôs academic contributions can be accessed <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CPH3qsUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">here</a>.</p> <p>Stay tuned for more discussions on the future of human-computer interaction in upcoming events!</p> <div class="post_img"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/20250508/successful-seminar-explores-emotion-aware-voice-interfaces.jpg" alt=""/> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="images"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Successful Seminar Explores Emotion-Aware Voice Interfaces]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Memorable Moments‚Äî‚Äî KLIC Students &amp;amp; Faculty Shine at CHI 2025 in Yokohama üåü</title><link href="https://sszhao74.github.io/blog/2025/CHI-Moment/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Memorable Moments‚Äî‚Äî KLIC Students &amp;amp; Faculty Shine at CHI 2025 in Yokohama üåü"/><published>2025-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sszhao74.github.io/blog/2025/CHI-Moment</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sszhao74.github.io/blog/2025/CHI-Moment/"><![CDATA[<p>This May, KLIC students and faculty came together at the prestigious CHI conference in Yokohama, Japan! üáØüáµ From insightful discussions to sharing innovative ideas, our team made the most of this incredible opportunity.
