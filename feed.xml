Held at the CMC 7001 Social Media Lab, CityU, and streamed via Zoom, the event attracted a diverse audience of researchers, students, and practitioners in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).</p> <p> </p> <div class="post_img"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/20250514/WeChatImage_20250514154222.jpg" alt="" width="800"/> </div> <p><br/> Prof. Williams delivered a compelling talk titled <strong>“Using Adaptive Experimentation to Design Intelligent Interventions for Belief &amp; Behaviour Change.”</strong> He introduced <em>Intelligent Interventions</em>—personalized prompts, educational content, and health messages—powered by the <strong>AdaptEx framework</strong>. This innovative system integrates large language models (LLMs), crowdsourcing, and adaptive A/B testing to optimize digital interventions in real time. By transforming interface elements into learning agents, AdaptEx enables rapid experimentation and continuous improvement in user engagement and behavior change. <br/></p> <p> </p> <div class="post_img"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/20250514/WeChatImage_20250514151409.jpg" alt="" width="800"/> </div> <p><br/> With over 85 publications and accolades including Best Paper awards and 1st place in the 1M dollars Xprize for experimentation technology, Prof. Williams’ research has impacted over 500,000 users globally. His interdisciplinary work spans computer science, psychology, statistics, and AI, supported by more than 2M dollars in research funding.</p> <p>The <strong>Greater Bay ACM SIGCHI Chapter</strong>, a network of HCI researchers across the Greater Bay Area of China, organized this event to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration. The talk exemplified their mission to connect technology, industry, and humanities through impactful HCI research.</p> <p>For more on Prof. Williams’ work, visit <a href="tiny.cc/williamspapers">tiny.cc/williamspapers</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Talk"/><category term="Greater"/><category term="Bay"/><category term="ACM"/><category term="SIGCHI"/><category term="Chapter"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prof. Joseph Jay Williams Presents on Intelligent Interventions for Behavior Change]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Successful Seminar Explores Emotion-Aware Voice Interfaces</title><link href="https://sszhao74.github.io/blog/2025/successful-seminar-explores-emotion-aware-voice-interfaces/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Successful Seminar Explores Emotion-Aware Voice Interfaces"/><published>2025-05-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sszhao74.github.io/blog/2025/successful-seminar-explores-emotion-aware-voice-interfaces</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sszhao74.github.io/blog/2025/successful-seminar-explores-emotion-aware-voice-interfaces/"><![CDATA[<div class="post_img"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/20250508/successful-seminar-explores-emotion-aware-voice-interfaces.jpg" alt="" width="1000"/> </div> <p><br/> On May 8th, <strong>Dr. Yong Ma</strong> from the University of Bergen delivered a seminar titled <strong>“Designing Emotion-Aware Voice Interfaces: Challenges, Insights, and Future Directions”</strong>.</p> <p>Dr. Ma explored how <em>speech signal processing</em> can be utilized to detect emotional cues and cognitive states in a non-intrusive manner. He shared findings from studies on speech emotion recognition, discussing the complexities of distinguishing between genuine and acted emotions, as well as the role of machine learning models in identifying subtle emotional differences.</p> <p>The seminar also touched upon ethical concerns, including potential biases and the broader societal impact of emotionally intelligent systems. Dr. Ma underscored the importance of user-centered design in crafting empathetic and culturally inclusive voice technologies.</p> <p>For those interested in further exploring this research, Dr. Ma’s academic contributions can be accessed <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CPH3qsUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">here</a>.</p> <p>Stay tuned for more discussions on the future of human-computer interaction in upcoming events!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="images"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Successful Seminar Explores Emotion-Aware Voice Interfaces]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Memorable Moments—— KLIC Students &amp;amp; Faculty Shine at CHI 2025 in Yokohama 🌟</title><link href="https://sszhao74.github.io/blog/2025/CHI-Moment/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Memorable Moments—— KLIC Students &amp;amp; Faculty Shine at CHI 2025 in Yokohama 🌟"/><published>2025-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sszhao74.github.io/blog/2025/CHI-Moment</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sszhao74.github.io/blog/2025/CHI-Moment/"><![CDATA[<p>This May, KLIC students and faculty came together at the prestigious CHI conference in Yokohama, Japan! 🇯🇵 From insightful discussions to sharing innovative ideas, our team made the most of this incredible opportunity.
