The first introduced the <strong>Fundamental Over-Attribution Error (FOE)</strong>, a cognitive bias describing how users project human-like traits and intentions onto AI systems, particularly under risk and uncertainty. The study used multiple research methods, including experiments, surveys, and psychometric scale development, to establish FOE as a distinct construct that influences perceptions of AI reliability and intent.</p> <p>The second study explored how anthropomorphic design impacts trust and risk perception in <strong>AI-assisted decision-making</strong>, based on a large-scale experiment involving financial advisory chatbots. Results showed that anthropomorphic features reduced perceived risk by increasing both cognitive and affective trust. These effects were moderated by users’ domain expertise. Participants with lower expertise were more prone to misplaced trust, while those with higher expertise responded more critically.</p> <p>Dr. Reani concluded by discussing the implications of these findings for <strong>responsible AI design</strong>, emphasizing the importance of calibrating user trust and mitigating bias when developing anthropomorphic decision-support systems.</p> <p><strong>Time:</strong> November 6, 2025 (Thursday), 3:00–4:00 PM (BJT)<br/> <strong>Venue:</strong> SM6058, City University of Hong Kong <br/><br/><br/></p> <h3 id="about-the-speaker">About the Speaker</h3> <p></p> <p><img src="/assets/img/posts/manuele-reani.jpg" alt="Dr. Manuele Reani" width="20%"/></p> <p></p> <p>Dr. Manuele Reani is an Assistant Professor at the School of Management and Economics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen).

Visual-touch fusion is an interactive paradigm innovation driven by spatial task requirements, which helps the efficient and intelligent development of human-machine-environment collaboration. Its core lies in multidisciplinary cross-disciplinary research to address the perceptual and cognitive problems of visual-touch stimulation and the challenge of lagging development of tactile technology. The research team combined the model framework of cognitive processing and motion control, and expanded the multi-sensory feedback mechanism of vision, touch, etc. with sensory conflict and motion constraints as the main line, providing a theoretical basis for conducting research on the visual-touch fusion interaction paradigm. In view of the limitations of traditional tactile actuation technology, the research team developed a thin and light structure, high-efficiency, and high-temporal and spatial resolution electrotactile interface to expand its tactile rendering capabilities, and initially developed a visual-touch integrated human-machine collaborative interaction platform to serve important human-machine collaborative interaction fields such as embodied intelligence and remote operation.</em></p> <p><strong>About the Speaker:</strong> Han Teng is Deputy Director of the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a National Excellent Young Scholar.
