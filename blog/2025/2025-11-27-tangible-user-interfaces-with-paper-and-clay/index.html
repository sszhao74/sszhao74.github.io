The session explored how <strong>paper and clay</strong> can be used to create buttons and touch sensors.</p> <p>The session was designed to be <strong>hands-on</strong>, encouraging participants to engage with physical materials rather than working solely on screens. Students were invited to bring their <strong>laptops</strong>, preferably with <strong>USB Type A ports or adapters</strong>, to connect with the materials.</p> <div class="post_img"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/Image_20251127161915.jpg" alt="" width="1000"> </div> <p>During the session, participants experimented with making physical components function as touch-sensitive inputs, gaining practical experience in TUI design. Professor Zhu guided attendees through the process of turning everyday materials into interactive elements, providing a tangible approach to understanding user interfaces.</p> <p>This session is part of <strong>KLIC’s bi-weekly activities</strong>, which aim to create a collaborative and learning-focused environment for labs and students interested in Human–Computer Interaction.</p> <h2 id="about-the-speaker">About the Speaker</h2> <p><strong>Professor Zhu Kening</strong> is a faculty member at the <strong>City University of Hong Kong</strong>. His research focuses on <strong>Human–Computer Interaction</strong>, particularly in the areas of tangible user interfaces, interactive design, and hands-on learning methods. Professor Zhu has led multiple workshops and sessions on physical computing and TUI, providing students with practical experience in designing interactive systems.</p> </body></html>
