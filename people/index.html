Victor’s practice focuses on robotic fabrication, computational design, and developing custom machines, tools, and end effectors for creative production. Victor is an Assistant Professor at the School of Creative Media, where he teaches courses on interactive machines, computational design, and digital fabrication.</p> <p>Central to his work is a belief that automation should serve to enhance human potential, not replace it. While much of his research focuses on advancing the precision and complexity of robotic fabrication, its broader aim is to address a persistent issue in society: the burden of repetitive, physically taxing labour. Industries like construction and manufacturing are still marked by tedious, manual work that limits human potential. By enabling machines to take on these repetitive roles, human intelligence can focus on higher-level, creative, and problem-solving tasks. In this way, automation is not a threat but as an opportunity to reshape our relationship with work and, ultimately, to design better environments for ourselves.</p> <p>Victor holds a Doctor of Science from ETH Zurich, where he developed new methods for robotic timber assembly using distributed robotic tools. His research explored how the design-to-assembly process can be transformed through robotics, addressing challenges like high assembly forces, precise alignment, and the simultaneous closure of integral timber joints. This work contributed to broader conversations on non-repetitive robotic assembly and earned recognition, including the Best Paper Award at CAADRIA 2021. Victor also completed a Master of Science in Architectural Studies (Design and Computation) at MIT and a Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies at the University of Hong Kong. His experience spans technical consulting for digital artists and architects, contributing to kinetic installations, custom robotic machines, and 3D-printed structures exhibited at venues such as the Venice Biennale and Science Gallery Melbourne. He has taught digital fabrication, computational design, and robotic assembly at institutions including ETH Zurich, MIT, the University of Hong Kong, the Singapore University of Technology and Design, and workshops at international venues such as the AA Visiting School and the ACADIA conference. He believes in hands-on, curiosity-driven learning, encouraging students to engage with the tools and technologies that shape our built environment.</p> </div> <div class="people_content"> <strong>Research Interests:</strong> <span style="font-size: 14px; font-color: #666666; font-weight: 400"><p>#Digital Fabrication / #Robotic Assembly / #Design to Production / #Task and Motion Planning / #Distributed Robotic Tools / #Parametric Design / #CAD CAM</p> </span> </div> <div class="more-info people_content"> </div> <div class="people_content"> <strong>Web:</strong> <a class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm" role="button" aria-pressed="true" href="https://www.victorleung.info/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Personal Homepage</a> <a class="btn btn-outline-info btn-sm" role="button" aria-pressed="true" href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=heZKUKgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> </div> </div> <div class="image-container" style="text-align: right;"> <img src="/assets/img/people/faculty/victor_leung.png" alt="Leung Pok Yin Victor"> </div> </div> <div class="profile-style"> <div class="info-container"> <h4 style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 24px">Liu Can</h4> <div class="people_content"> <strong>Position:</strong> Associate Professor</div> <div class="people_content"> <strong>Lab:</strong> <a href="https://sweb.cityu.edu.hk/canliu/team.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ERFI Lab</a> </div> <div class="people_content"> <strong>Bio:</strong> <p>Dr Can Liu is a researcher in Human-computer Interaction (HCI).
